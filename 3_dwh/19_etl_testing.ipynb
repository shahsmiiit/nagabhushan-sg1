    "- correctly **extracted** from sources,\n",
    "- correctly **transformed** according to business rules,\n",

    "## Why ETL Testing is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "ETL Testing matters because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decisions depend on data**  \n",
    "  Incorrect revenue, wrong customer mapping, or missing orders can lead to bad business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Errors are expensive when discovered late**  \n",
    "  If a bug reaches the Gold layer and dashboards are built on it, fixing it later can require reprocessing, backfills, and stakeholder rework.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pipelines change constantly**  \n",
    "  New sources, new columns, rule changes, and schema updates can silently break logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data issues are common in real-world feeds**  \n",
    "  NULLs, duplicates, inconsistent city names, invalid emails, late arriving data, and wrong categories are common and not exceptional.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trust is hard to earn and easy to lose**  \n",
    "  Once business users lose trust in reports, adoption drops and the warehouse becomes underused.\n"

    "## Where ETL Testing Fits in a DWH Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A common DWH pipeline has layers like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bronze**: consolidated raw landing (minimal changes, add lineage like `source_system`)\n",
    "- **Silver**: cleansed and standardized (apply business rules, remove bad data, deduplicate)\n",
    "- **Gold**: business-ready model (star schema, facts & dimensions, calculated measures)\n",
    "\n",
    "ETL tests should be present at **each layer**:\n",
    "- Bronze tests confirm **ingestion correctness** (e.g., duplicates, row counts, schema drift).\n",
    "- Silver tests confirm **transformation correctness** (e.g., standardization rules, filters, dedup rules).\n",
    "- Gold tests confirm **analytics correctness** (e.g., measures, referential integrity, completeness from Silver → Gold).\n"

    "\n",
    "Most ETL tests fall into these categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Completeness**  \n",
    "   Are all expected records present? Did we lose anything during transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accuracy**  \n",
    "   Are values correct based on the rules? Are calculations correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validity**  \n",
    "   Do values conform to expected formats/ranges? (e.g., email format, dates)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Uniqueness**  \n",
    "   Are keys unique where they must be? (e.g., `order_id` in Silver/Gold)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Consistency**  \n",
    "   Are values consistent across datasets and over time? (e.g., city mapping)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Referential Integrity**  \n",
    "   Do fact rows correctly reference dimension keys?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Timeliness / Freshness**  \n",
    "   Is the data updated within required windows? Is `load_timestamp` progressing?\n",

    "8. **Reconciliation**  \n",
    "   Do totals match between layers and/or sources? (counts, sums, revenue)\n"

    "## Designing a Simple ETL Test Framework \n",
    "\n",
    "A practical pattern is to:\n",
    "1. Generate a unique **test_run_id** for a run.\n",
    "2. Run each test and capture:\n",
    "   - `test_name`\n",
    "   - `status` (PASS/FAIL)\n",
    "   - `actual_value` (usually a count of violations)\n",
    "   - `expected_desc`\n",

    "## Best Practices for ETL Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test early and at every layer**: Don’t wait until Gold to detect issues.\n",
    "- **Use counts and sums for reconciliation**: Row counts, revenue sums, distinct keys.\n",
    "- **Make tests deterministic**: Same input should always yield same result.\n",
    "- **Keep tests small and readable**: One rule per test is easier to debug.\n",
    "- **Log test results**: Storing in a QA table enables audit and trend tracking.\n",
    "- **Automate**: Run tests as part of the pipeline (after each load).\n",
    "- **Treat failing tests as blockers**: If critical rules fail, stop the pipeline and investigate.\n"
