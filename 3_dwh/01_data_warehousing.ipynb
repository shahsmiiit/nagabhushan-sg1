    "\n",

    "### Key Characteristics of a Data Warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1990, **Bill Inmon**, known as the *Father of Data Warehousing*, defined four essential characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integrated**  \n",
    "   - Data from multiple operational and external systems is combined into a unified format.  \n",
    "    - Cleaned\n",
    "    - Standardized\n",
    "    - Unified into a consistent format\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subject-Oriented**  \n",
    "   - Data is organized by subject areas (e.g., customers, products, sales), not by application. \n",
    "        - Sales\n",
    "        - Customers\n",
    "        - Finance\n",
    "        - Products\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time-Variant**  \n",
    "   - Contains **historical data** (not just current state), enabling trend analysis over time.  \n",
    "    - Daily snapshots\n",
    "    - Monthly trends\n",
    "    - Year‑over‑year comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Non-Volatile**  \n",
    "   - Data is **stable between refresh cycles**.  \n",
    "   - New or updated data is loaded in periodic batches (e.g., nightly).  \n",
    "   - Once loaded, data is not modified by transactional updates.  \n",
    "   - It is **not deleted**\n",
    "    - It is **not updated frequently**\n",
    "    - Data is mostly append‑only\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures reporting stability.\n"

    "   - Even supports exploration of the *unknown* through advanced analytics.  \n",

    "   - All data is consolidated into a single repository.  \n",
    "   - Eliminates the need to gather scattered data from multiple operational systems.  \n",
