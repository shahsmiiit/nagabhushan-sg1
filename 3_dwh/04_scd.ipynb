    "## What is a Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Slowly Changing Dimension** is a dimension table where attribute values change **infrequently over time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike fact tables, dimension tables represent descriptive information such as:\n",
    "- Customer profile\n",
    "- Product details\n",
    "- Employee attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling changes in dimension attributes is a **core data modeling decision** in data warehousing.\n",

    "## SCD Type 0 – Fixed Dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Type 0 dimensions do not allow any changes after data is initially stored.\n",
    "The values are considered permanent and remain unchanged throughout the lifecycle of the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "This type is suitable for attributes that are inherently static, such as:\n",
    "- Date of birth\n",
    "- State or country codes\n",
    "- Zip codes\n",
    "- Social security or national identification numbers\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "In Type 1 dimensions, changes are handled by overwriting existing values with new ones.\n",
    "No historical information is preserved, and only the most recent value is retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "This approach is appropriate when historical data is not required, such as:\n",
    "- Correcting data errors\n",
    "- Updating customer addresses\n",
    "- Modifying contact details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "When an update occurs, the old value is replaced directly in the dimension table.\n"

    "### Description\n",
    "Type 2 dimensions preserve full history by inserting a new record whenever an attribute changes.\n",
    "Each version of the record is stored separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "- A new surrogate key is generated for each change\n",
    "- Natural keys are used to relate records across versions\n",
    "- Both current and historical records coexist\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "Common techniques include:\n",
    "- Status flags indicating active or inactive records\n",
    "- Effective start and end date columns\n",
    "This approach is widely used for attributes such as product configurations or role changes.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "This method is useful when:\n",
    "- Only one level of history is required\n",
    "- Changes occur periodically\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "A new column is added to store the previous value, alongside the column holding the current value.\n",

    "- Data changes frequently\n",
    "- Detailed historical auditing is required\n",

    "The current table is updated with new values, while older records are moved to a dedicated history table.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Initial Assessment\n",
    "Evaluate the existing dimension tables and identify attributes that may require historical tracking.\n",
    "Understand which attributes are currently static and which may evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decide on SCD Types\n",
    "Select the appropriate SCD type based on business requirements.\n",
    "This decision should involve collaboration between data engineers, analytics engineers, and analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Pre-existing Data\n",
    "Determine how to manage historical gaps:\n",
    "- Start tracking changes from the current point forward\n",
    "- Attempt to reconstruct historical data where feasible, with caution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing SCDs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Schema Design\n",
    "- Type 1: Update records directly\n",
    "- Type 2: Add columns such as Start_Date, End_Date, and Is_Current\n",
    "- Type 3: Add columns to store previous values\n",
    "- Type 4: Maintain separate current and history tables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ETL Processes\n",
    "ETL logic must detect changes in source data and apply the correct SCD handling strategy.\n",
    "This includes managing surrogate keys and maintaining referential integrity.\n"

    "### ETL-Based Maintenance\n",
    "ETL pipelines compare incoming data with existing records to identify changes.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Change Data Capture (CDC)\n",
    "CDC captures changes in near real time.\n",
    "It is particularly important for Type 2 dimensions, where every change must be recorded without data loss.\n",

    "### History Tracking with Effective Dates\n",
    "Using consistent timestamps and effective date columns ensures accurate validity periods for records.\n",
    "Database-generated timestamps are often preferred for consistency.\n",
