    "## Understanding Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Big Data** refers to extremely large and complex datasets that cannot be handled by traditional data processing applications. These datasets come from various sources such as social media, sensors, transactions, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 4 Vs of Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension | Description |\n",
    "|------------|--------------|\n",
    "| **Volume** | Refers to the massive amount of data generated every second. Organizations deal with terabytes to petabytes of data. |\n",
    "| **Velocity** | Describes the speed at which new data is generated, collected, and processed — often in real-time. |\n",
    "| **Variety** | Represents the different types of data — structured, semi-structured, and unstructured (text, images, audio, etc.). |\n",
    "| **Veracity** | Refers to the trustworthiness and accuracy of the data collected. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Size Units\n",
    "\n",
    "| Unit | Size |\n",
    "|------|------|\n",
    "| 1 Byte | 8 bits |\n",
    "| 1 Kilobyte (KB) | 1,024 Bytes |\n",
    "| 1 Megabyte (MB) | 1,024 KB |\n",
    "| 1 Gigabyte (GB) | 1,024 MB |\n",
    "| 1 Terabyte (TB) | 1,024 GB |\n",
    "| 1 Petabyte (PB) | 1,024 TB |\n",
    "| 1 Exabyte (EB) | 1,024 PB |\n",

    "\n",
    "Big Data allows organizations to:\n",
    "- Gain deeper business insights\n",
    "- Improve operational efficiency\n",
    "- Personalize customer experiences\n",
    "- Enable predictive analytics and real-time decision making\n",

    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is an open-source **distributed data processing framework** designed for speed, scalability, and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Spark\n",
    "- **In-memory computation** for faster performance.\n",
    "- **Supports multiple languages** — Python (PySpark), Scala, Java, R, SQL.\n",
    "- **Rich APIs** for streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.\n",
    "- **Scales horizontally** across a cluster of machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spark Ecosystem Components\n",
    "- **Spark Core** – The foundation, responsible for distributed computation.\n",
    "- **Spark SQL** – For structured data queries using SQL.\n",
    "- **Spark Streaming** – For real-time data processing.\n",
    "- **MLlib** – For machine learning operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "RDD is the **fundamental data structure in Spark**. It represents an **immutable distributed collection of objects** that can be processed in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of RDDs\n",
    "- **Resilient** – Fault-tolerant with automatic recovery from failures.\n",
    "- **Distributed** – Data is divided across multiple nodes.\n",
    "- **Immutable** – Once created, cannot be modified.\n",
    "- **Lazy Evaluation** – Operations are not executed until an action is triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RDD Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transformations** – Return a new RDD from an existing one (lazy).\n",
    "   - Examples: `map()`, `filter()`, `flatMap()`, `distinct()`\n",
    "2. **Actions** – Trigger computation and return a result.\n",
    "   - Examples: `count()`, `collect()`, `first()`, `saveAsTextFile()`\n",
